Ray Tracer
==========

Ray tracing is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the ffects of its encounters with virtual objects. Ray tracing is not the fastest way to render an image. It 
is very computationally heavy. Ray tracing uses a realistic simulation of lighting over other rendering methods. Special 
effects such as shadows, reflection and refraction are a natural resut of the algorithm. 



## What is implemented:
  1. Soft shadows
  2. Glossy Reflection
  3. Refraction
  4. Depth of Field
  5. Anti-aliasing


## What still needs to be implemented:
  1. Multi-threading
  2. Texture mapping

The program may have some features commented out due to the exponential running time 
of these features.
